  Happy numbers are positive integers that follow a particular formula:
  take each individual digit, square it, and then sum the squares to get a new number.
  Repeat with the new number and eventually, you might get to a number whose squared sum is 1.
  This is a happy number. An unhappy number (or sad number) is one that loops endlessly.
  Write a function that determines if a number is happy or not.
