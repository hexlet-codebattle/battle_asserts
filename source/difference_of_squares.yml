  "Find the difference between the square of the sums and the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers.
  The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
  (1 + 2 + ... + 10)**2 = 55**2 = 3025
  The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
  1**2 + 2**2 + ... + 10**2 = 385
  Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
  natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640."
