  The Baudot code or International Teleprinter Code was invented by Emile Baudot in 1870.
  It was used for teleprinter messages instead of the morse code.
  Baudot uses five bits per character, thus allowing up to 32 distinct characters.
  As a technique used to extend this limitation, the code uses up-shift and down-shift modes as is used on a typewriter.
  In the Baudot code, each five bits transmitted must be interpreted according to whether they are up-shifted (figures) or down-shifted (letters).
  For example, the bit pattern 11111 represents up-shift and the bit pattern 11011 represents down-shift characters.
  All characters transmitted after the sequence 11111 but before the shifted sequence 11011 are treated as up-shift characters.
  All characters transmitted after the sequence 11011 are treated as down-shift characters until the pattern 11111 is recognized.
